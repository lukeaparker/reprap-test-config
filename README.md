# RepRAP Test Config
This is a RepRap firmware configuration for a large format CoreXY dual extrusion 3D printer. I built this configuration using 
the RepRap Configuration Tool which can be found here: https://configtool.reprapfirmware.org/Start

To view the exact configuration details, check out the config.json file, or edit the config by uploading the config.json file
to the RepRap Configuration Tool linked above.
